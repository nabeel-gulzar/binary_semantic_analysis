# binary_semantic_analysis

In this project we implement binary semantic analysis over tweets dataset.
#
Firstly we download dataset from drive.
#
Then we unzip it and apply preprocessing over it.
#
After featurizing the tweets into a 2 dimension vector we apply logistic regression.
#
Confusion matrix is reported in the notebook.
